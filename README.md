# Docker based PHP-FPM

## How to use

Just copy docker-compose.yml from dist example

    cp docker-compose.dist.yml docker-compose.yml

Then build

    docker-compose build

And run composition

    docker-compose up -d

## What next?

similar repository, but with some small tunes and additional containers.
